# Together App

Together App is a Flutter application designed to help users discover various items through a user-friendly interface. It leverages the Flutter framework to provide a seamless user experience for browsing and exploring different items.

## Features

- **Discovery Page**: The main feature of the app is the Discovery Page, where users can scroll through a list of items fetched from an API.
- **Lazy Loading**: Items are fetched dynamically as the user scrolls down the Discovery Page, ensuring smooth performance and efficient data usage.
- **Item Model**: The app utilizes a custom `Item` model to represent each item fetched from the API. This model includes properties such as ID, title, description, and image URL.
- **HTTP Requests**: HTTP requests are made to a mock API to fetch items for display on the Discovery Page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app's UI is designed to adapt to various screen sizes, providing a consistent experience across different devices.
